Run the script with:

```
$ ./jbang demo.sh
```

or if `jbang` is already installed (or this directory is on your `PATH`):

```
$ ./demo.sh
```

It's a simple Spring Boot application that uses a Java 25 anonymous `main()`. The dependencies are managed by `jbang` and are declared in the script header via a utility catalog in Github.
